## 🌐 Web Scraping
The project scrapes IMDB's Top 250 movies using Python. The script extracts the following movie details:
- 🎬 **Title**
- 📅 **Year of Release**
- ⭐ **IMDB Rating**
- 🎭 **Genres**
- ⏳ **Duration**
- 📝 **Number of Reviews**
- 🎥 **Director**

Scraped data is stored in `IMDB_TOP250.csv` for further analysis.

## 🗄️ Data Storage & Processing
- The raw movie data undergoes preprocessing to clean inconsistencies.
- Missing values are handled, data types are corrected, and unnecessary columns are removed.
- The structured dataset is used for SQL-based querying and visualization.

## 🛠️ SQL Queries & Analysis
Using **MySQL**, the project performs insightful queries, including:
- Fetching **top-rated movies** 🎥
- Identifying **most common genres** 🎭
- Analyzing **yearly trends in top movies** 📊
- Extracting **most influential directors** 🎬
- Determining **average movie duration by genre** ⏳

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project utilizes **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to generate visual insights, including:
- Rating distributions 📈
- Popular genres over time 🎭
- Director impact on ratings 🎥
- Year-wise movie trends 📅
- Review count vs. rating correlation 🔍
